## Overview
1) Explain why you might to use SAS macros and how they work
2) Walk through examples of using macro in SAS code
3) List tips/tricks/common stumbling blocks for using SAS macros
4) List resources where you can learn more

## Efficiency 
>- If you ever copy and paste your code to run it again with minor changes
>- If you know your code will need variable or value changes in the future
>- If you produce dated reports

Macros will help reduce code development and maintenance time!

## How to use SAS macros to increase your code efficiency 
> - Develop working code without macro coding 
> - "Macrotize" your code:
>   - Replace hardcoded values with macro (where possible)
>   - Add conditional/iterative processing with macros (where possible)   
>- Macros will enable you to make relatively small changes to use your code over a wide variety of scenarios

## Macros are a text processing facility
>* When you submit code in SAS, it goes to a memory location called the input stack.
>* In the input stack, the **word scanner** reads the text from left to right
>* The word scanner recognizes two macro triggers that begin with two token sequences:

<font size="5">

    &name-token: a macro variable
    
    %name-token: a macro statement, function, or call
    
</font size>


## Text processing facility

<font size="6">

>* When the word scanner encounters one of the two macro triggers, it sends the macro to the macro processor.
>* The macro processor resolves the macro and passes it back to the compiler, where the rest of the code processing happens.
